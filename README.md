# Recursive Web Directory Brute-Forcer

This tool is designed to brute-force hidden directories or files on a web server. It recursively tries different paths and filenames to uncover potentially hidden resources or directories that might not be publicly visible. This is often used in web security assessments or penetration testing to discover misconfigured or unprotected web directories.

## Features

- **Recursive Directory Brute-Forcing**: The tool will recursively test directories and subdirectories on the web server.
- **Customizable Wordlists**: Use custom wordlists for testing different directory and file names.
- **Status Code Checking**: The tool reports on HTTP status codes for each attempted path (e.g., 200 OK, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found).
- **User-Agent Customization**: Allows setting a custom User-Agent header to bypass some protections.
- **Rate-Limiting**: Built-in delay between requests to avoid overwhelming the server and to simulate human-like behavior.
  
## Requirements

- Python 3.x or higher
- `requests` library for making HTTP requests

### Installing the Required Libraries

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recursive-web-directory-bruteforcer.git
   cd recursive-web-directory-bruteforcer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To start the brute-forcing process, run the script with the following command:

```bash
python recursive_web_directory_bruteforcer.py <url> <wordlist> <depth>
```

**Arguments**:
- `<url>`: The target URL to scan. Ensure you include `http://` or `https://` in the URL.
- `<wordlist>`: Path to the wordlist file containing potential directory or filename names.
- `<depth>`: The depth of recursion. Set `depth=1` for scanning the top level only, and increase for deeper recursion.

#### Example:

```bash
python recursive_web_directory_bruteforcer.py https://example.com /path/to/wordlist.txt 3
```

This will start scanning `https://example.com` for directories and files using the specified wordlist, with recursion set to a depth of 3.

### Output

The tool will print status information for each request, including:

- **Attempted Path**: The full URL path being tested.
- **HTTP Status Code**: The response status code returned by the server (e.g., `200`, `403`, `404`).
- **Response Time**: The time it took to receive the response from the server.

Example Output:

```
[200 OK] https://example.com/admin
[403 Forbidden] https://example.com/secret
[404 Not Found] https://example.com/nonexistent
[200 OK] https://example.com/uploads
```

### Options

You can customize several parameters:

#### 1. **Custom Headers**:
   - Add custom headers (e.g., `User-Agent`, `Authorization`) if necessary to avoid blocks or rate-limits:

```bash
python recursive_web_directory_bruteforcer.py https://example.com /path/to/wordlist.txt 3 --user-agent "Mozilla/5.0"
```

#### 2. **Rate-Limiting**:
   - You can set a delay between requests to prevent server overload and to simulate human-like interactions:

```bash
python recursive_web_directory_bruteforcer.py https://example.com /path/to/wordlist.txt 3 --delay 1
```

This will introduce a delay of 1 second between requests.

#### 3. **Verbose Output**:
   - For more detailed information, you can enable verbose output:

```bash
python recursive_web_directory_bruteforcer.py https://example.com /path/to/wordlist.txt 3 --verbose
```

This will print more detailed output during the execution of the brute force attempt.

## Example Directory Scanning

Assuming your wordlist contains common directory names like "admin", "uploads", and "images", here is what the output might look like:

```
Scanning https://example.com...

[200 OK] https://example.com/admin
[403 Forbidden] https://example.com/secret
[404 Not Found] https://example.com/notfound
[200 OK] https://example.com/uploads
[404 Not Found] https://example.com/images
```

### Recursion Example

If you are scanning with recursion (e.g., depth 2), the tool will check subdirectories under any discovered directories. For example, if `/admin` is found, it will attempt to check `/admin/uploads`, `/admin/config`, etc.
